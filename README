= What's this? =

A flexible, web-administrable door latch control system.  It should run on
Linux just fine and is probably pretty easily ported to other *nix or
*nix-like systems.  (As part of our development, we used X86 laptops,
Linksys NSLU-2, and a Raspberry Pi board.)

Originally written primarily at the Baltimore Hackathon 2012 [1] for the
Baltimore NODE [2] and the Load of Fun space on North Ave [3], we are
releasing it under the AGPLv3 [4] in hopes that it is useful to others.

= What do I need to build it? =

The controller itself uses sqlite3, libevent2 (core only), and OpenSSL for
PBKDFv2.  The web UI uses PHP (and needs PHP sqlite3 support).

(About licensing: sqlite3 is public domain, libevent2 is 3-clause BSD, and
OpenSSL is "Apache-like".  PHP appears to place no restriction on the
programs written in it; Luci is Apache 2.0.)

= What's here? =

controller/doorcontrol.c - The door controller/observer daemon
runit/doorcontrol/run    - and runit script

runit/fswebcam/run       - webcam scraper runit script
misc/fswebcam.crontab    - crontab to prune image buffer

luci                     - an incomplete, abandoned web UI

web/*                    - PHP based attempt at web UI

COPYING, Makefile, README - Standard stuff :)
